/* Print the number equal to R directly as an integer constant (without using variable names or symbolic
constants).
Now using assignment statement set the value of r as a value equal to R directly.
Separate the digits of r as x and y using appropriate C statements.
Print r, x, y.
Perform bit wise operations (i) AND (ii) OR with x and y and print the result.
Compute x*4 using bit wise operation and print the result */
